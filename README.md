# Password Generator Starter Code
For this weeks project we had to use our knowledge of JavaScript to create a password generator that creates a random password upon request. Here are the simplified steps that I created based on the acceptance criteria and used as a guide as I went through the challenge:

1   Generate Password Button: The user clicks a button to initiate the password generation process.

2   Password Criteria Prompts: The user is presented with a series of prompts to specify the criteria for the generated password. These prompts could include options for character types, length, etc.

3   Select Criteria: The user selects which criteria they want to include in the password. This may include options like lowercase, uppercase, numeric, and special characters.

4   Password Length: The user is asked to choose a password length within the range of at least 8 characters and no more than 128 characters.

5   Character Types: The user confirms whether they want to include lowercase, uppercase, numeric, and/or special characters in the password.

6   Input Validation: The user's input is validated at each step to ensure that the selected criteria meet the requirements. At least one character type should be selected to ensure the password is sufficiently strong.

7   Password Generation: Once all prompts are answered and the criteria are validated, the application generates a password that matches the selected criteria.

8   Password Display: The generated password is then either displayed in an alert to the user or written to the page, so the user can access and use it.

Below I have attached a screenshot of a randomly generated password created by my application:
